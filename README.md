### Description

An app that will help you quit or take a break from league. It automatically checks if you play every day and keeps track of streak for you. It features a customizable leaderboard so you can compete with your friends.

### Motivation

I play too much League of Legends and my brother told me is taking a two week break and I was thinking I should do the same but I didn't have any good programming ideas so I kept going back to League. So I thought of this. ;)

### Cron Job

Using GitHub actions to check player history every 12 hours (hits nextjs api route)
